Releasing the archetypes turned out to be cumbersome. Thus I'm documenting how I managed to do it.

Checkout the master branch of the fox-archetypes repository and run the following commands with Maven 2.2.1:
mvn release:prepare  # tag name should be just the version number
mvn release:perform

The release did neither work with Jenkins due to http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5856 nor with Maven 3.

In addition to that add the new archetype version to the file 'archetype-catalog.xml' and
upload it to: https://app.camunda.com/confluence/pages/viewpageattachments.action?pageId=7668278
