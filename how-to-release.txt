Releasing the archetypes turned out to be cumbersome. Thus I'm documenting how I managed to do it.

Checkout the master branch of the fox-archetypes repository and run the following commands with Maven 2.2.1 (tag name should be just the version number):
mvn release:perform 
mvn release:perform

The release didn't work with Jenkins due to http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5856 nor with Maven 3.
